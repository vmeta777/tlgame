# Patch 1.1

This patch updates the Tabletop Simulator Mod with all Special Edition cards and the Rare Pepes set. The "Digital Collectibles" deck has been updated and a new Rare Pepes themed Deck has been added. See Decklists for more on these!

### On the Horizon: 

Re-working the mod to make space for the release of a new collection
More Pre-made Starter Decks
Forking off of this patch so that players can go back to this version instead of future updates with more cards available
