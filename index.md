## About This Site

This website is a repository of information regarding `"Timeline Game"`, the playable digital card game and NFT Collection from Violet House. It is your source for all information regarding the past, present and future of Timeline Game. 

The website is built as an exocore. The exocore was developed by [Remilia Corporation](https://remilia.org) as a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) workflow and extension of [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) to complete the system of an accessible and standardized auto-publishing knowledgebase network, as a proof-of-concept for [Remilia's New Internet](https://mirror.xyz/charlemagnefang.eth/831rVsd2Z7cjxnBAw118gW8MylKibfC2AeJ6YUHiAvA).

## The Timeline Game Exocore

On the menu to the left-hand side, there are a number of categories linking to sections with information about the game. The Articles section includes long-form background on the game. The Wiki has general information, including links to the original Mirror articles, information about the Factions and more to come. The Decklists section includes information about playable decks, starting with the ones that come pre-built inside of the Timeline Game Steam Workshop Mod.  The Patch Notes section informs about updates to the Mod.

"Latest Posts" aggregates all recent updates. The Archive displays articles in an easy-to-read form, as does the Index, which sorts articles by "tag". Scrapbook/Library/Webring are all remnants from the basic exocore which are not used explicitly at the moment, but may be in the future.
