# Digital Collectibles Decklist

The Digital Collectibles Deck was one of the starter decks released with OG Timeline Game. It has since been updated to add "Times Square" from the NFT NYC Special Edition collection. Some other changes have also been made.

## Basic primer on the deck:

This deck revolves around the Ape NFT Trader card as well as Influencer, King of the Apes and NFT/Ape-type cards to use with them both. Ape NFT Trader's FLIP ability allows the player to flip a coin and potentially improve an NFT-type card in play by replacing it with one that costs more from the deck. 

There are cards that help guarantee you get the pieces you need to make the deck work such as "Alpha Group" which allows you to trade in two cards for similarly-costed cards from your deck, "Apeguard Sentry" which helps the controller find the Ape type cards they need and "Da Swamp House" which lets the player search their deck for an NFT card whenever an Ape is played. Once the right pieces are in play, cards like "Influencer, King of the Apes" and it's PUMP/DUMP abilities can help you turn a stable board position into a winning one. Mog Hat as the chosen Hyper Rare is just a very useful card that turns a good attacker into a great one. In tandem with other pieces here, it can win a game.

Like all starter decks, this deck is meant for beginners and could be refined in a number of ways. 

Some possible variations on this Deck:

The deck could index further on NFT-type cards and environments rather than Apes

The deck could play a slower style that peaks later in the game with fewer Apes and more control by adding another Delete, 3x Ratio, 3x Void Nymph and 3/3 World to incentivize non-attacking turns

The deck could choose to make NFTs more of a sub-theme and become a more Ape-themed deck.
