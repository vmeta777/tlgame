# Timeline Game - Special Edition

The Timeline Game Special Editions are a collection of limited release cards for collectors of Timeline Game's original release, which can be claimed through a variety of methods, varying for each individual Special Edition. Some are burn-redeems, requiring an original Timeline Game card to be burned, others are free mints for holders of Timeline Game or simply holders of specific cards. There are the NFTNYC and REMICON Japan set of cards, which celebrate the week in April not long after Timeline Game minted, featuring in large part environment cards which effect the entire board and reflect the environments that these events took place in. This set also includes other one-off cards such as Samurai Ottie, a variant on the original "Ottie" as well as the special "Shiro Hat" cards, two of which will be released later this month.
