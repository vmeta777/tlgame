# Timeline Artist MAC

[MAC](https://twitter.com/mackrypt0), a long-time Milady, and multimedia artist, was the last addition brought on for the original Timeline collection, creating clay representations of classic Remilia characters such as Charlotte Fang and Neodoujinshi favorite Radbro. 

MAC is a unique talent who added a lot to the OG Timeline collection with his clay skills. He has also worked with the Radbro Webring on "Radcats" and his talents extend into claymation as well as traditional art styles.

In addition to "OG" Timeline, MAC worked on the art for roughly half of the subsequent Timeline Game "Rare Pepes" drop this spring, including the Surfing Peepo and Honkler, pictured below.
