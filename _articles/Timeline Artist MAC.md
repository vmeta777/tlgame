# Timeline Artist MAC

[MAC](https://twitter.com/mackrypt0), a long-time Milady and multimedia artist, was the last addition brought on for the original Timeline collection, creating clay representations of classic Remilia characters such as Charlotte Fang and Neodoujinshi favorite Radbro. MAC is a unique talent who has also worked with the Radbro Webring on "Radcats" and whose skills extend into claymation and traditional art styles.

MAC also worked on the art for roughly half of the subsequent Timeline Game "Rare Pepes" drop this spring, including the Surfing Peepo and Honkler, pictured below.
