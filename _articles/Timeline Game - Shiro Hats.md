# Timeline Game - Shiro Hats
The Timeline Game Special Edition "Shiro Hats" set is an edition of three cards (with one bonus variant) by [Timeline artist Shiro](https://timelinegame.net/articles/timeline-artist-shiro), in her "Oh, I see" style. Each are an "Outfit" type card, which, in game, are attached to another card to give them combat strength and utility. 

The first card to be released was the Mog Hat, which reaches back to an ancient era of the timeline; Gaia Online, one of the precursor social networks/forums which also innovated on digital collectibles, including their "OMG" and "AFK" hats, pictured below, which we used for inspiration.

The OMG Hat was one of the first Donation Items on Gaia, released in November 2003 (!!) - each month, if you donated to Gaia, they would give you a "Thank You Letter" item in your inventory, which could be opened to redeem one of two items. They could be equipped or sold. Both hats have been in high demand since their inception. Our take on the hats for Timeline Game are a nod to this period of collecting and communicating on the internet.
