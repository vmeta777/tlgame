# Timeline Game - Rare Pepes

The Timeline Game Rare Pepes collection is a set of twelve cards inspired by the "original NFT card", the Rare Pepes. They were entirely free to mint for holders of Violet House NFTs including Timeline Game, Water Mililys and a few popular Remilia Neodoujin collections like Radbro. They were released both as a nod to the original Rare Pepes collection as well as to commemorate a $pepe token craze that was sweeping the Timeline in Spring of 2023.

The Rare Pepes collection includes throwbacks to Pepe "derivative" characters such as Peepo and Honkler, as well as some totally different and new takes on the popular frog, including a Pepe demi-god/avatar, which GPT4 schizo-generated out of the ether when asked about Japanese frog deities.

The set adds a new Pepe archetype and support line for Timeline Game as a playable game, while also calling back to an era on crypto twitter that won't be forgotten anytime soon. It includes clay art, digital illustrations + AI renditions of painted Pepes in the style of Picasso, Francis Bacon and more.
