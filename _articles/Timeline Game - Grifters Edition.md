# Timeline Game - Grifters Edition

The Timeline Game Grifters Edition was a spur of the moment collection inspired by the many bad actors in the crypto and NFT space at large. At time of writing, it has not been continued, for a number of reasons, though it may be continued at some point in the future. The only two cards in the set are the Grifted Milady "Conceptual Art Token" (inspired by Ryder Ripps RR/Milady) and "Grift Machine" inspired by NFT_Machine's Arcade DAO.
