# Timeline Artist Black

[Black](https://twitter.com/spiralform) is a net artist, creator of Timeline Game and Violet House through which he has released a number of NFT collections including Timeline (and associated sets), Water Mililys and Violet House Winter '23. An experienced AI collaborative artist with skills in multiple creative mediums, many of his art releases have featured a synthesis of some kind, often using AI to combine loved things into something new yet familiar.

Timeline Game brought the crypto twitter Timeline into a MTG-style sci-fi/fantasy trading card game aesthetic, while Water Mililys combined a number of influences from fine art (Monet's Water Lilys) and avant netart (Milady Auras) into one of the earliest and most well-received Milady derivatives.

His background in bringing people together on creative endeavors began at a very young age, starting a comic book production house as a schoolboy and continuing to create, often in writing, for the years to follow. Inspired by Remilia's approach in bringing sincere, thorough creations onto the blockchain, his aim is to produce resonant works that can challenge preconceptions and present things in a different light. Alongside fellow Timeline artists Krug and MAC, Black is also one of the earliest members of the BRG netart collective.
