To play Timeline Game online, you need to own a copy of Tabletop Simulator on Steam and access the custom mod which has been set up and ready to play since the collection released.

Alternatively, you can print out copies of the cards at home and play with them! We will have more support on how to do this in a simple way that you can print and cut them out in the future. We also may do some print runs of the cards.
