# Notes on Game Design

As a playable game, Timeline Game is born out of an enthusiasm and love for the trading card game genre. Many notes were derived from popular games in the space. In this article, I'll go through the major influences - what was absorbed into the game, what wasn't - and why.

## Magic the Gathering

Richard Garfield's Magic the Gathering is known for many things in the trading card game space. For example, the color wheel, the release cadence which sees numerous sets released each year and the trading card 'game' concept itself. Prior to Magic the Gathering, trading cards were collectables for fans of something, baseball players, TV shows and the like. Garfield's development of Magic the Gathering made these collectables something one could actually play with. There were many aspects of the original Magic the Gathering that have been discussed at length elsewhere, we'll only look at the ones pertinent to Timeline Game here.

### Game Speed - The Land System + the Color Wheel

Magic has a number of elements embedded which modify the speed at which a game is played from start to finish.  To begin the game, a player starts with twenty life - a number which also effects the speed it takes each game to conclude - and draws a hand of seven cards. In Timeline Game, due to changes which will be elaborated on later here, we start with twenty-five life, or hit points. We begin each game by drawing five cards instead of seven. 

Within each deck in Magic the Gathering, there are "lands". These make up typically just under half of the cards in each deck. Lands are equivalent to mana or energy. These are the restriction which limit players from simply playing every card in their hand. A card will typically have a bifurcated cost, requiring a specific type of land ("red" or mountain, "white" or plains, for example) and a certain amount of any type of land. 

The land system is a restriction which magnifies the complexity of MTG immensely. By making certain cards unplayable without a corresponding land of that color, players are forced to choose which types of cards and lands they will put into their deck. Players often attempt to play multiple different colors, meaning they will need to draw the corresponding lands during the game. In MTG there are many modifications with regard to lands - I.E., lands that do things beyond just letting you play a certain type of card: there are lands that heal you when played, lands that act as "two" or more colors, with certain drawbacks, and so on. 

As you can see, this system becomes very complicated. This depth is part of what has made Magic a global success. There's a world of theorycrafting and optimizing that can be done to make your lands fit your deck. 

It also creates a lot of pain points for new players.

There is, for example, a phenomenon known as "mana screw" or, inversely, "mana flooding". Mana screw is when you do not draw the lands needed to play the cards in your hand, or in the case of flooding, when you draw more lands than you need, leaving you with not enough cards to do something with. The color wheel ties into this. While the color wheel keeps players honest and doesn't allow them to use all of the best cards in one deck, trying to push the color wheel and corresponding land system to the limit can create these problems and stop players from having fun. 

For Timeline, I wanted the game to be fun and easy to pick up for a beginner. So I made these systems superfluous. To do that I drew on design decisions made in other games and rather than gating powerful cards behind lands, I gated them behind time and combo-style effects.

Some aspects of the land system were kept in place. In Timeline Game, each turn, for the first five turns, you draw one "poster" card from a poster deck. Posters submit "posts" which can be used to satisfy the requirement of playing *any* card. You can only have a maximum of five posters in play at a time. The game is balanced around this and the quill system, which adds some depth to the now-simplified land/posting system.

### The Quill System and "Disembodied" Posters

Each poster in Timeline Game has an effect which states that whenever this card contributes a post to play another card, that player can take a "Quill Token" from a pool of fifteen Quill Tokens at the side of the table. These quills can be hoarded and used at will, with four Quills being returned to the pool to "disembody" a poster. A disembodied poster can contribute two posts rather than one. With eight quills in a player's possession, for example, a player could use a total of seven posts to play cards. 

This system serves two functions, firstly adding a new strategic element to a familiar MTG-style format, as not only do they amp up a player's potential per turn, quill tokens can be hoarded and therefore denied from the opposing player once the quill pool runs out.

Additionally, they encourage players to have decks which allow them to play cheap cards early and often, so as to acquire more tokens. 

### Yu Gi Oh and Discarding the Color Wheel

With the removal of the color wheel, and a standardized mana curve, some requirements had to be reinserted so that the game didn't become too standardized. Yu Gi Oh's use of cards which are required to play other cards were my solution to the color wheel. 

Rather than This works especially well because now that there isn't a 45% chance of a land being the card drawn for each player on any given turn, players now draw "playable" cards which can be built around every turn.
